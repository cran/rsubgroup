Changes in version 0.6 (2014-09-10)
===================================
* Improvements:
  * optimizations in the beam search algorithm
  * significant memory optimization (dataset storage, access)
  * ARFF: enable import of "empty" attributes, i.e., with an empty value domain
  (this can occur, for example, when importing columns with only 'NA' in R)  

* Bug fixes:
  * exclude target from subgroup attributes
  * fix loading of ARFF file, for attributes/values with trailing spaces
